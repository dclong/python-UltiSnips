Package Cipher

Symmetric- and asymmetric-key encryption algorithms.

Encryption algorithms transform plaintext in some way that is dependent on a key or key pair, producing ciphertext.
Symmetric algorithms

Encryption can easily be reversed, if (and, hopefully, only if) one knows the same key. In other words, sender and receiver share the same key.

The symmetric encryption modules here all support the interface described in PEP 272, "API for Block Encryption Algorithms".

If you don't know which algorithm to choose, use AES because it's standard and has undergone a fair bit of examination.
Module name 	Type 	Description
Crypto.Cipher.AES 	Block 	Advanced Encryption Standard
Crypto.Cipher.ARC2 	Block 	Alleged RC2
Crypto.Cipher.ARC4 	Stream 	Alleged RC4
Crypto.Cipher.Blowfish 	Block 	Blowfish
Crypto.Cipher.CAST 	Block 	CAST
Crypto.Cipher.DES 	Block 	The Data Encryption Standard. Very commonly used in the past, but today its 56-bit keys are too small.
Crypto.Cipher.DES3 	Block 	Triple DES.
Crypto.Cipher.XOR 	Stream 	The simple XOR cipher.
